##This is for the purpose of tutorial materials for participants of interns and participants of the workshops

### Download Putty using following Link (to connect to hpc clusters from windows:)

https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.74-installer.msi

Enable X11 forwarding from Connection > Ssh > X11

In Session > Host: hpc.ku.edu.np

Logging Click on save for easy access in future.
Host: hpc.ku.edu.np

For convience during the workshop make the following settings accordingly:
Windows> Appearance> cursor blink
Font: Lucida Console, Regular, 13
Connection> Login> yourusername


- When you connect to hpc you may receive some security prompt click on Yes.
- Please read policy of kuhpc before entering password.
- If you receive connection error try using wired connection and retry connecting.
- If you don't use Putty for long time you will be logged out automatically so you need to reconnect it.


### Download Winscp

We use winscp to browse files inside super computer. You can also transfer file to and from hpc.
https://winscp.net/eng/index.php


# Connecting HPC using Linux 

Type this in terminal


```
ssh -X username@hpc.ku.edu.np
```

`-X` is flag used for x-forwarding which is used for showing gui programs like plot etc.


You will be prompted with password. Password typing will not be shown.



## Andriod Phone

You can use terminus app and follow Linux Terminal guide.

## OSX Phone

You can use terminal app or iterm and follow Linux Terminal guide.


## Changing password

In terminal type following command


```
passwd
```


You will be asked to type old password, new password and retype new password. Enter password that are 8 digit long.



### Mouting Lustre file system in home directory

```
ln -s /mnt/lustre/username scr0
```
Replace `username` with your `username`.


This creates `scr0` in your home directory. Its just a symbolic link. You can think of it as shortcut for ``/mnt/lustre/username`


### Making Directory in HPC

To create a folder/directory you can use following command.

```bash
mkdir -p directory_name
```

`-p` flag will ensure if there is directory it doesn't error out.


### Renaming file or folder in HPC

```bash
mv filename  final_filename
```

it changes `filename` to `final_filename`

`mv`  command is also used to move file from one directory to another directory.



## Loading Modules

In HPC we import the modules. There are various module available like compiler toolchain, fortan compiles, gcc, clang, growmacs etc.


To list all the available module.

```bash
module avail
```

To load module

```bash
module load module_name
```

Replace module_name with module that you need too run job.


## Copying files from your pc to hpc (from terminal)
Suppose if you want to copy the files in your pc to the scr0 folder in your hpc account

```bash
scp -r path_of_the_file_to_copy username@hpc.ku.edu.np:~/scr0/

```

`~` means home directory which is usually /home/username


# Managing Jobs
In HPC we do computation which is called jobs. Before submitting jobs please ensure you have loaded modules properly.


### Submitting Jobs

We use SLURM which stands for Simple Linux Utility Resource Manager. We use sbatch command to schedule job.

```
sbatch filename
```

### Checking Job Status

All jobs are queued in HPC. To check the queue informations you can use following command.

```bash
squeue -l
```

## run.slurm file for Gamess calculation run

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J H20_Geom        #Job name
#SBATCH -p normal          #Partition name
#SBATCH -o job.%j.log      #Name of the stdout output file (%j expands to jobID)
#SBATCH -N 1               #Total number of nodes requested
#SBATCH -n 4               #Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 30:00           #RUN time (hh:mm:ss) - 1.5 hours

#load needed modules
module remove openmpi3/3.1.4

module load mvapich2/2.3.2
module load openblas/0.3.7
module load gamess/2020R1

#Launch executable
rungms geometry.inp
```

## To download avogadro:
Download it from the link `https://sourceforge.net/projects/avogadro/`

If you are a linux (Debian based) user you can install it from the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install avogadro
```

For other type of linux like arch linux please search for `avogadro` in your package repository


### Copyig and Pasting in Terminal

To copy

Use shortcut key `ctrl  c`
To Paste:

In Linux you can use shortcut like `ctrl+shift+v`
In Windows usually you can do by right click

# Vi Guide
For editing file you can use `nano` or `vi`. `Nano` is easier for  begineer.


There are three mode in vim. Two mode are important for us

1. Normal Mode
2. Insertion Mode


To go to Insertion Mode you can press `i` button
To go to Normal Mode press `esc` button.


In insertion mode you can type like normal edit. Edit it in insertion mode and to save type it like this


`esc` `wq!`


`esc` takes to normal mode

`w` means write
`q` means quit
`!` some time writing can have issue to force we use exclamation mark. Usually exclamation mark is not needed.
